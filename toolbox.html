    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/laurenth-personal/LightingTools.LightProbesVolumes"><strong>Light Probes Volumes -</strong></a> Light probes take samples during the baking proccess and unity will use the probes to completely fake realtime lighting on dynamic objects (avatars) in realtime with an extremely small filesize and computation. VRChat's current version of unity only lets you place them individually by hand; all this addon does is let you fill a room with them in couple clicks. (I think later unity versions have a tool like this included.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://vrcprefabs.com/browse"><strong>VRC Prefabs -</strong></a> A large community run database of unity prefabs, most of the ones on this list were found here.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanEmu"><strong>Cyan Emulator -</strong></a> A standalone package that emulates VRC Udon and spawns in a desktop player whenever you hit the "Play" button at the top of the unity editor. (I cannot believe the VRC SDK even shipped without it.)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp"><strong>UdonSharp -</strong></a> A C# to VRC Udon compiler. Lets you write code in C# using standard unity stuff and will compile it into udon for you. Any actions not possible or permitted in udon will give compiler errors.</li>
