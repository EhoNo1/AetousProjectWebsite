        <h3>Disclaimers & Important Notices</h3>
            <p>These notices and warnings are in no particular order.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I cannot include anything that would get me in trouble. -</strong> As these commision projects will be hosted on a 3rd party platform (VRChat), I cannot allow or include any content that breaches the platform's respective Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or any other contract or document that could threaten my standings on the platform.</li>
                <li><strong>These prices are not final and only serve as an estimate. -</strong> Finished projects can vary wildly in the amount of work required to execute; as a result the final cost can only be calculated after some disscussion on what the project will require.</li>
                <li><strong>Once completed, you are responsible for archiving and backing up your project. -</strong> Once the project is done and finalized, you will recieve a link to download an archived copy of the project. I will try too, but I am not responsible for keeping this download link alive indefinetly.</li>
                <li><strong>I am not reponsible for keeping the world up to date after the project is finished. -</strong> VRChat is a platform in continous development, and I cannot be held responsible for fixing things every time something breaks. If VRChat updates break certain functionalities of your project, I may choose too, but am not responsible for fixing it after the project has been closed.</li>
                <li><strong>The project may take a while. -</strong> I don't do this as a job. I have a life outside of this, and it may take some time to get your project done. I enjoy making maps, but sometimes its difficult or impossible to find time to work on your commision.</li>
                <li><strong>Both of us reserve the right to cancel and refund the project at any point, for any reason. -</strong> At any point during development, for any reason, decide that the project shouldn't continue. Ideally, I want a heads up before cancellation, but its okay to just</li>
